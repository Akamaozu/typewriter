# Segment Typewriter Configuration (https://github.com/segmentio/typewriter)
# Just run `npx typewriter@next` to re-generate a client with the latest versions of these events.

# Currently, Typewriter is configured to read the token from TYPEWRITER_TOKEN in your environment.
# Alternatively, you can supply this token using a shell command, which could use your team's secret
# management tooling to fetch a shared Segment API token.
# For example, at Segment, we use https://github.com/segmentio/chamber for secret management,
# and https://github.com/segmentio/aws-okta to perform SSO with Okta.
# Our configuration looks like this:
# tokenCommand: aws-okta exec dev-privileged -- chamber export app | jq -r .typewriter_segment_prod_token

# You can configure the options of this language's generator.
# See: https://segment.com/docs/typewriter/javascript
